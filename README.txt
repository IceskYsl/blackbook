Blackbook
http://rubyforge.org/projects/contentfree/

== DESCRIPTION:
  
Blackbook automates the nitty-gritty of importing contacts from various services and files and exporting them as VCard, XML, or simple Hash. Utilize those contacts from services like AOL, GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail or CSV to help your social networking site become GIGANTIC overnight! You'll be able to get big and sell for millions before anyone figures out it's just like every other social network.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
The current list of supported services and file types:

Import:
* AOL
* CSV files
* Gmail
* Hotmail
* Yahoo! Mail

Export:
* Simple hash (default)
* Vcard
* XML

If you create an additional importer or exporter - or simply find a bug - please consider submitting it as a patch to the project so the community can all benefit from your hard work and ingenuity. 

== SYNOPSIS:

# An example of fetching Gmail contacts - by default, returns an array of hashes with :name and :email
  contacts = Blackbook.get :username => 'me@gmail.com', :password => 'whatever'

# or returning XML
  contacts = Blackbook.get :username => 'me@gmail.com', :password => 'whatever', :as => :xml
  
# or importing from a CSV file 
  contacts = Blackbook.get :csv, :file => #<File:/path/to/file.csv>

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Mechanize and its dependencies, for interacting with online providers
* Fastercsv for reading CSV, Mechanize >= 0.7.0 for page scraping

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install blackbook

== THANKS:

Big thanks to Marton Fabo for figuring out why Mechanize couldn't log in to AOL.
